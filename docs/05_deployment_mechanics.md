# 05 — Deployment Mechanics (Baseline)

## Baseline concept
Deployable tape-measure monopole:
- stowed along a rail or panel
- restrained by burn-wire / release mechanism (implementation-specific)

## Key risks
- incomplete deployment
- snagging on edges
- unexpected coupling to structure

## v0.1.0 deliverable
A documented concept with integration constraints in the ICD and a verification checklist.
