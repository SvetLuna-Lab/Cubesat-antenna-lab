# 02 — Trade Study (Candidates)

## Candidates
1) Deployable quarter-wave monopole (baseline)
- Pros: simple, light, strong UHF baseline, fast to validate
- Risks: deployment reliability, ground reference / chassis interaction

2) Turnstile / crossed dipoles (future)
- Pros: better near-omni coverage
- Risks: mechanical complexity, interaction with structure, tuning effort

3) S-band patch (extension path)
- Pros: compact, directional gain, throughput-friendly
- Risks: pointing constraints, substrate choice, manufacturing tolerances

## Evaluation criteria
- Coverage vs gain
- Deployment risk / mechanical complexity
- Integration risk (grounding, feedline, EMC)
- Verification difficulty (can we measure S11, repeat results?)
