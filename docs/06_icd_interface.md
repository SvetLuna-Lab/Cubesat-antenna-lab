# 06 — ICD (Interface Control Document)

## Mechanical interface
- Mount location: define a reference face and coordinate system
- Keep-out zones: deployment arc must remain clear
- Fasteners/adhesives: document chosen method and torque (if applicable)

## Electrical interface
- Feedline: length, type, routing constraints, bend radius
- Connector/interface: document SMA/U.FL (or chosen standard)
- Grounding: define chassis ground reference points
- ESD/EMC: handling and integration precautions

## Integration rules (baseline)
- Minimize feedline length and avoid sharp bends
- Keep RF away from noisy switching nodes where possible
- Record every change that affects RF (routing is a design parameter)
